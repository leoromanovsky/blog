Welcome to my blog! Hope you enjoy my writing and it kicks off a conversation together.

I'm a founding software engineer at [Eppo Data](https://www.geteppo.com), 
previously contributing to [Uber's self-driving car program](https://www.uber.com/blog/machine-learning-model-life-cycle-version-control/) and an early engineer at [Strava](https://www.strava.com) as part of its infrastructure team.
